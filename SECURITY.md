## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

If you discover a security vulnerability in the Breeze Payment Gateway plugin, please report it by emailing **security@breeze.com**.

Include as much of the following as possible:

- Type of vulnerability (e.g. XSS, SQL injection, authentication bypass)
- The file(s) and line number(s) involved
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if available)
- Potential impact and attack scenarios

## What to Expect

- **Acknowledgement** within 2 business days.
- **Status update** within 7 business days confirming whether the report is accepted or declined, and an estimated timeline for a fix.
- **Credit** in the release notes for responsibly disclosed vulnerabilities (if desired).

We ask that you give us a reasonable amount of time to address the issue before any public disclosure.

## Scope

This policy covers the plugin source code in this repository. It does not cover the Breeze API or hosted infrastructure — please contact **security@breeze.com** for those as well and we will route accordingly.
