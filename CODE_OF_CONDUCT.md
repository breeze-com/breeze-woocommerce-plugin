Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviours they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
